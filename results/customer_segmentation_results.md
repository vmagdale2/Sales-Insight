# Customer Segmentation (Clustering) Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aimed to segment stores based on sales performance, revenue generation, and product variety to identify distinct customer behavior patterns. By leveraging **K-Means Clustering**, we successfully identified meaningful segments that provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** `sales_2_final.csv`
- **Source:** Provided CSV file
- **Key Features Used:**
  - `sales` - Total sales per store
  - `revenue` - Total revenue per store
  - `unique_products` - Number of distinct products sold per store
  - `avg_transaction_value` - Average value of customer transactions
  - `sales_per_product` - Sales normalized by product variety

---
## 🔍 Key Insights
Based on the clustering results, the following insights were derived:

### **Cluster 0: Low Sales/Revenue with Limited Product Variety**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Generally low sales and revenue figures.
  - Limited variety in product offerings.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Focus on cross-selling strategies or bundling promotions to improve revenue.

### **Cluster 1: High-Performing Stores**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Strong revenue performance with consistent sales across multiple product lines.
  - Higher `avg_transaction_value` and `sales_per_product` values indicate strong consumer spending patterns.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Maintain current strategies and explore premium product expansions.

### **Cluster 2: Niche or Specialized Stores**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Sales may vary widely, but they specialize in specific product types with consistent customer interest.
  - Product mix management could be enhanced.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Introduce targeted marketing campaigns to maximize returns on niche products.

### **Cluster 3: Balanced Performance Stores**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Balanced sales, revenue, and product variety with moderate `avg_transaction_value`.
  - These stores may serve as valuable testing grounds for new product launches or pilot campaigns.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Experiment with localized promotions or seasonal strategies to boost performance.

## 📈 Visualizations
The following Tableau visualizations were created to enhance understanding of the results:

1. **Cluster Distribution Scatter Plot**
   - **X-axis:** `sales`
   - **Y-axis:** `revenue`
   - **Color by:** `Cluster`

2. **Average Transaction Value vs. Sales per Product**
   - Visualizing the relationship between spending patterns and product variety.

3. **Cluster Breakdown by Store Count**
   - Pie chart or bar chart showing store count distribution across clusters.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Cleaned and processed sales data to ensure data integrity.
- Created new features including:
  - `unique_products` (count of distinct products sold per store)
  - `avg_transaction_value` (revenue / total sales)
  - `sales_per_product` (sales normalized by product variety)

### Step 2: Clustering with K-Means
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to identify the optimal number of clusters (K=4).
- Scaled the dataset using `StandardScaler` to ensure fair clustering results.

### Step 3: Analysis
- Evaluated each cluster’s performance by analyzing:
  - Sales
  - Revenue
  - Product variety
  - Average transaction value
  - Sales per product

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Integrating geographical insights if location data becomes available.
- Exploring additional clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering for improved segmentation.
